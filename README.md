# SQL-POWER-BI

2 files are downloaded and imported in SQL Server Management
1 excel file (Budget) was just downloaded from the internet 
After Cleaning and Transforming data, resaults was saved as CSV file and imported into Power BI
In Power BI, first I do is transforming data in Power Query, and make some changes in DAX
After that I made relations between tables and made some measures
At the end I made visualisations
